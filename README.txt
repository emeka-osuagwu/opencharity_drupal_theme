##OPENCHARITY
----------------------
The opencharity theme was created based on drupal 7 theme evaluate.


The base Zen theme is designed to be easily extended by its sub-themes. You
shouldn't modify any of the CSS or PHP files in the zen/ folder; but instead you
should create a sub-theme of zen which is located in a folder outside of the
root zen/ folder. The examples below assume zen and your sub-theme will be
installed in sites/all/themes/, but any valid theme directory is acceptable
(read the sites/example.sites.php for more info.)

  Why? To learn why you shouldn't modify any of the files in the zen/ folder,
